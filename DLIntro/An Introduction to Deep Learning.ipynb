The Oak Ridge Frontier supercomputer requires 20 MW of power to perform the same computation. The fastest response from the brain is about 100ms and its storage capacity is estimated as somewhere between 1TB and 2.5PB. All this from something like:\n",

    "In particular, the myelinated axon trunk allows action potentials to travel rapidly and efficiently along the axon through the process of saltatory conduction. The myelin sheath insulates the axon, enabling the electrical signal to jump between the Nodes of Ranvier, which speeds up nerve signal transmission and conserves energy. This process is vital for the fast and coordinated functioning of the nervous system, especially in large and complex organisms like humans. A key aspect is that the action potential, first generated at the axon hillock, only progates when the neuron's membrane potential reaches a threshold. "

Their original conception consisted of a set of binary inputs, $x_i$, and a single binary output, $y$: if $\\sum_i x_i  > \\Theta$ then $y = 1$, where $\\Theta$ is some threshold value. In 1958, Rosenblatt extended this model to create the perceptron which weights the inputs, $w_i x_i$ and then passes the sum of the products to an activation function, $f$, which determines the output: \n",

Let's consider the L2 loss so ${\\cal L} (y, p) = \\sum_i(p_i - y_i)^2$ and the change in the loss with a change is the weights is given by $\\frac{\\partial {\\cal L}}{\\partial {\\mathbf w}} = \\frac{\\partial {\\cal L}}{\\partial p} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial {\\mathbf w'}}$.

One way of doing this is by updating the weights iteratively to progressively reduce the loss function and hopefully converge on an optimal set. We can use $\\frac{\\partial {\\cal L}}{\\partial {\\mathbf w}}$ to navigate down the gradient of the loss function and moderate the amount by which we update the weights at each iteration by a factor known as the learning rate, so the update strategy becomes:\n",

    "### Training the MLP: backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "However, just stacking a lot of MLPs together is not enough: we need a way to train such a network. It took about 20 years for the development of the now standard technique: backpropagation or reverse mode of automatic differentiation. Paul Werbos first formulated it for neural networks in 1974, but it was David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams in 1986 who popularized the method, leading to its widespread adoption in training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already considered how to train a single neuron (see above) and we can train a MLP with a very similar approach. One thing to be aware of is what the derivative of the activation function might look like: functions that are not continuous will be non-differentiable at particular values of the dependent variable and this could be problematic (unless the behavior can be constrained). For example, the ReLU activation function (shown above) is strictly non-differentiable at zero but the value of the derivative can be defined as 0 or 1 as appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the idea of backpropagation is that we first forward propagate through every layer of the network to get the predicted value and calculate the value of the loss function. We then backpropagate this across every layer in reverse order updating the weights by the appropriate delta (update) as we proceed. So if a network has 5 layers, to calculate the backpropagated error for layer 1, we would first forward propagate from layer 1 => layer 2 => ... => layer 5 => output activation and then backpropagate from output activation => layer 5 => layer 4 => ... => layer 1 and then apply this delta to update the weights of every node in layer 1.\n",

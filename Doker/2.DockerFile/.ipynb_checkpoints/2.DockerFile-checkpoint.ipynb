    "A Dockerfile is a plain text configuration file used to define the steps for building a Docker image. It is a critical component of the Docker ecosystem, allowing developers to automate the process of creating reproducible and consistent container images. Dockerfiles are used to encapsulate the configuration and dependencies of an application or service, making it easier to package, distribute, and deploy software as containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dockerfile typically includes a series of instructions, each on a separate line, that dictate how the image should be constructed. The Docker engine interprets these instructions and builds the image layer by layer. When a new container is created from the image, the file system is constructed based on these layers, making it efficient and fast.\n",
